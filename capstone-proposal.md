Project's Purpose or Goal: This project will help a local optometrist office organize and update their website to be cleaner and better organized. It will also remove uneccesary pieces cluttering the website.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

1. Website will have a contact form that will link to the office's help email and send questions/comments/concerns straight to the email.

2. Website will be well organized and have duplicate code removed to keep it organized and easy for prospective patients to use.

3. Website will make use of an 'update' banner, which will display recent update messages and be removable via an exit button.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
